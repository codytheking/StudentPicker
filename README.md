# Student Picker

This JavaFX application will read names from a text file and display a random name.

It will go through the entire list before picking the same name again.

## Usage

Download the zip file (link below) and unzip it. In the folder you will find text files (e.g. period1.txt). These text files have sample names, but you should replace them with the names of your students (only one name on each line).

Launch the program and start picking!

**Note: On Mac OS you may get a warning message when trying to run the app. Go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy and select "Open Anyway"**
