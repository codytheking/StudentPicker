# Student Picker

This JavaFX application will read names from a text file and display a random name.

It will go through the entire list before picking the same name again.

## Usage

Download StudentPicker.jar and create a .txt file named period<period number>.txt in the root of your project folder, where period number is an integer number (1, 3, etc.)

Launch the program and start picking!
